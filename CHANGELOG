v0.4 [ongoing]
- Reworked project_home
- Added bar - series1 set
- Added DORA - Lactam set
- Updated templates (mol, bb) so app can handle 3 BBs containing series
- Updated plots, combos and MMPs so app can handle 3 BBs containing series
- Fixed top50 for mols_home if no filtering
- Added min_data_points to boxPlot form as filtering option
- Fixed various bugs around MMPs scoring
- Added rank for BB

v.03
- Multiproject support implemented. Welcome foo data.
- Added session: Project - Series
- Updated all queries according to the defined session
- Added swarmPlot to for duo/property analysis
- Added Design: 1BB-based suggestions of non existing mols is available
- Added BPI (balanced permeability index)
- Added mols/bbs filters on main properties

v0.2
- Added MMPs support: for a given bb_id quickly identify outperforming replacement.
- Unified bbs_home view with filter + results.
- Unified molecules_home view with filter + results.
- Added BB coverage in mol_home: this allow to quickly identify bb_id not tested in a given assay.
- Added bbs ppties statistics to BB model.
- Added trio link to bb_home: for a given property and bb_id display all trio that were not synthesized that could improve the property.
- Added mol_flag to display stereochemistry flags
- BB are now defined via rules (EL) and are no more manually added. The bb_id is thus new.
- Data is now fetch via Osiris directly (IG) to accelerate data processing.

v0.1
- Added count/zone to box plots.
- Added substructure search using 2D depiction container from openmolecules.org.
